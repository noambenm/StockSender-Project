This is my Python project called StockSender.
Its purpuse is to run every time the stock market opens, and when it does, 
compare the opening value of the VOO ETF to the past month avarage.
If the current price is 15% lower than the past month avarage, it sends an Email to me telling me that I should buy the ETF
